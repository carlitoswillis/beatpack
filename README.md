# beatpack

This app automates tedious tasks and solves the problem of the 'Type Beat' producer. Stem zipping, mp3 generation, cover art + logo overlaying, and splicing videos together with the track in the background. This app handles the rest so you can focus on the fun parts.
Created using Electron, and React this desktop application works on any platform to enhance the workflow of sonic artists seeking to increase their production speed.
